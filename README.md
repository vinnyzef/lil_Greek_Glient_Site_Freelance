# lil_Greek_Glient_Site_Freelance

## Welcome to the README for the freelance website I created for a Greek restaurant in Chicago!

* This website was built using a reactive frontend and backend, which provides a seamless user experience. The backend is supported by Sanity, a headless CMS that allows for easy content management and updates. The website features a modern design with a focus on the restaurant's Greek cuisine and culture.

* As a freelancer, I worked closely with the restaurant's team to create a website that reflects their brand and values. The website includes features such as online ordering, menu display, and an event calendar. The responsive design ensures that the website looks great on any device, from desktop to mobile.

* Thank you for taking the time to check out this project. If you have any questions or would like to learn more about my work, feel free to reach out!
